.SH PURPOSE
DSYR2K  performs one of the symmetric rank 2k operations

 or
.br

    C := alpha*A**T*B + alpha*B**T*A + beta*C,
.br

 where  alpha and beta  are scalars, C is an  n by n  symmetric matrix
 and  A and B  are  n by k  matrices  in the  first  case  and  k by n
 matrices in the second case.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 7
 UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
 On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower
 triangular  part  of the  array  C  is to be  referenced  as
 follows:

 UPLO = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq   Only the  upper triangular part of  C
 is to be referenced.

 UPLO = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq   Only the  lower triangular part of  C
 is to be referenced.

 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 TRANS  - CHARACTER*1.
 On entry,  TRANS  specifies the operation to be performed as
 follows:

 TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq   C := alpha*A*B**T + alpha*B*A**T +
 beta*C.

 TRANS = \(aqT\(aq or \(aqt\(aq   C := alpha*A**T*B + alpha*B**T*A +
 beta*C.

 TRANS = \(aqC\(aq or \(aqc\(aq   C := alpha*A**T*B + alpha*B**T*A +
 beta*C.

 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 N      - INTEGER.
 On entry,  N specifies the order of the matrix C.  N must be
 at least zero.
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 K      - INTEGER.
 On entry with  TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  K  specifies  the number
 of  columns  of the  matrices  A and B,  and on  entry  with
 TRANS = \(aqT\(aq or \(aqt\(aq or \(aqC\(aq or \(aqc\(aq,  K  specifies  the  number
 of rows of the matrices  A and B.  K must be at least  zero.
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 ALPHA  - DOUBLE PRECISION.
 On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
 k  when  TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  and is  n  otherwise.
 Before entry with  TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  the  leading  n by k
 part of the array  A  must contain the matrix  A,  otherwise
 the leading  k by n  part of the array  A  must contain  the
 matrix A.
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 LDA    - INTEGER.
 On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
 in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   When  TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq
 then  LDA must be at least  max( 1, n ), otherwise  LDA must
 be at least  max( 1, k ).
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 B      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDB, kb ), where kb is
 k  when  TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  and is  n  otherwise.
 Before entry with  TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  the  leading  n by k
 part of the array  B  must contain the matrix  B,  otherwise
 the leading  k by n  part of the array  B  must contain  the
 matrix B.
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 LDB    - INTEGER.
 On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
 in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   When  TRANS = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq
 then  LDB must be at least  max( 1, n ), otherwise  LDB must
 be at least  max( 1, k ).
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 BETA   - DOUBLE PRECISION.
 On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta.
 Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
 C      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDC, n ).
 Before entry  with  UPLO = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq,  the leading  n by n
 upper triangular part of the array C must contain the upper
 triangular part  of the  symmetric matrix  and the strictly
 lower triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the
 upper triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
 upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
 Before entry  with  UPLO = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq,  the leading  n by n
 lower triangular part of the array C must contain the lower
 triangular part  of the  symmetric matrix  and the strictly
 upper triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the
 lower triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
 lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
.TP 7
 LDC    - INTEGER.
 On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
 in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
 max( 1, n ).
 Unchanged on exit.
