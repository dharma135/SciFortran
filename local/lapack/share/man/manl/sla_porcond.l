.SH PURPOSE
   SLA_PORCOND Estimates the Skeel condition number of  op(A) * op2(C)
   where op2 is determined by CMODE as follows
   CMODE =  1    op2(C) = C
   CMODE =  0    op2(C) = I
   CMODE = -1    op2(C) = inv(C)
   The Skeel condition number  cond(A) = norminf( |inv(A)||A| )
   is computed by computing scaling factors R such that
   diag(R)*A*op2(C) is row equilibrated and computing the standard
   infinity-norm condition number.
