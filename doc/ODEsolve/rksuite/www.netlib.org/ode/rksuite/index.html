for	how to use the suite of codes to solve initial value problems.

file	<a href="details.doc">details.doc</a>
for	how the codes are organized.
,	In particular, there is a list showing for each routine
,	which routines it calls and which call it directly. Also,
,	routines communicate with each other by means of labelled
,	COMMON blocks.  They are described and details of their
,	usage by the routines are given.

file	<a href="templates">templates</a>
for	samples of how to use the suite to solve typical problems.
,	Each template comes in two variants.  An output file for
,	each template showing the results of the use of the
,	template in both its variants is provided.  Other
,	choices of methods are possible in some templates;
,	output using them is included in the output file.
,	That is, there are nine files in total (six with
,	extension .f and three with extension .out).
