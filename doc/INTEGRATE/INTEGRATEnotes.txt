Notes for INTEGRATE and Ordinary Differential Equations solvers in SciFor.
Some routines are already present. More to come from integration with intlib, quad-pack.

Quadpack naming:

Quadrature -> 	Non-adaptive	General integrand		S:Singularities handled
	      	Adaptive	Weight function of some form	P:Specified points of local difficulties
								I:Infinite interval
								O:Oscillatory weight function (cos/sin) on finite interval
								F:Fourier transform (cos/sin)
								C:Cauchy principal value

	
Subdivision of the routines is:

Integrating functions, given function object:

quad       = compute definite integral of a given function (Quadpack generic interface: 
QAGSe/QAGIe/QAGPe for no wighted functions - QAWOe/QAWFe/QAWSe/QAWCe).

fixed_quad = compute integral using fixed order quadrature (polynomial interpolation plus QAWC) [done]

romberg    = compute integral using Romberg adaptive method (NR code: qromb, qromo)


Integrating functions, given fixed samples:

traps      = cumulative integral using trapezoidal rule [done]

simps      = cumulative integral using Simpson's rule [done]

romb       = cumulative integral using Romberg rule (NR code gromb or IntLib)


Integrators of ODE systems.

odeint     = Integrate a system of ordinary differential equations (wrapper from lsoda from odepack.
the form is dy/dt = f(t,y0,â€¦)) 

ode        = A more generic class of ODE solvers (net lib: vode.f / zvode.f  - odepack: lsoda - Runge-Kutta: RK4.5/ RK8(5.3))

complex_ode= a complex functions interface.
